## Hero Section

### Headline

**Build AI video, image, and audio pipelines with a simple composable API**

### Subheadline

**Compose any image, video, and audio models through one unified API, without dealing with model differences or provider quirks.**

### Primary CTA

**Get Started** → [Link to docs]

### Secondary CTA

```bash
npm install @synthome/sdk
```

### Visual Element

[ILLUSTRATION: Abstract visualization showing multiple model provider logos (Replicate, Fal, ElevenLabs, Hume) connected through clean lines to a single unified interface/SDK box, flowing into a completed video output. Clean, modern, technical aesthetic with subtle gradient accents.]

---

## Pain Point Section

### Headline

**Integrating AI models shouldn't break your pipeline every time**

### Body Copy

Every AI model provider has different input formats, output structures, and API quirks. Adding a new model or upgrading an existing one means rewriting integration code and risking your entire pipeline.

Teams waste weeks building and maintaining orchestration layers for async jobs, retries, rate limits, and storage—just to get multiple models working together.

**The result?** Slower launches, brittle systems, and engineering time spent on infrastructure instead of features.

### Visual Element

[ILLUSTRATION: Split comparison showing "Before" (chaotic diagram with tangled connections between different model APIs and a codebase, error symbols, broken links) vs "After" (clean linear flow from models through Synthome to final output)]

---

## First Code Example Section

### Headline

**Three models, three lines of code**

### Subheadline

Generate a video, reframe it for social media, and add captions—no orchestration needed.

### Code Block

```typescript
import {
  compose,
  generateVideo,
  reframe,
  addSubtitles,
  replicate,
} from "@synthome/sdk";

const execution = await compose(
  generateVideo({
    model: replicate("bytedance/seedance-1-pro"),
    prompt: "A serene mountain landscape at sunrise",
    duration: 5,
  }),
  reframe({ aspectRatio: "9:16" }),
  addSubtitles(),
).execute();

console.log("Video ready:", execution.result.url);
```

### Supporting Copy

**That's it.** No manual API wrangling, no job queue setup, no state management. Just define your pipeline and run it.

---

## How Synthome Works Section

### Headline

**One API, any model, zero orchestration**

### Three-Column Value Props

#### Column 1: Provider-Agnostic

**Stop rewriting integrations**

Synthome normalizes inputs and outputs across Replicate, Fal, ElevenLabs, Hume, and more. Swap models or add new providers without touching your pipeline code.

[ICON: Plug-and-play connector or modular blocks]

#### Column 2: Composable Pipelines

**Chain models like functions**

Build complex workflows by composing simple operations. Generate images, create videos, add audio, apply effects—all in one declarative pipeline.

[ICON: Linked chain or connected nodes]

#### Column 3: Built-in Orchestration

**We handle the infrastructure**

Async execution, retries, job state, webhooks, and storage are included. No PgBoss, no queues, no DevOps overhead.

[ICON: Automated gears or orchestration flow]

## executeJSON / AI-Generated Pipelines Section

### Headline

**Let AI design your pipelines. Synthome runs them.**

### Body Copy

Define pipelines as JSON instead of code. Perfect for AI agents, dynamic workflows, or exposing pipelines to non-technical users.

Pass a structured JSON definition to `executeJSON()`, and Synthome handles the rest—whether the JSON was hand-written or generated by an LLM.

### Code Example

**Pipeline JSON:**

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {
      "type": "generateVideo",
      "model": "bytedance/seedance-1-pro",
      "prompt": "Product showcase with dramatic lighting",
      "duration": 5
    },
    {
      "type": "addSubtitles",
      "language": "en"
    },
    {
      "type": "reframe",
      "aspectRatio": "1:1"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Execute it:**

```typescript
import { executeJSON } from "@synthome/sdk";

const result = await executeJSON(pipelineJson, {
  apiKey: process.env.SYNTHOME_API_KEY,
});
```

### Use Cases (Bullet List)

- AI agents that generate and modify media workflows autonomously
- No-code interfaces for non-technical users
- Version-controlled pipeline definitions
- Dynamic workflow generation based on user input

### Visual Element

## Real-World Use Case Section

### Headline

**One pipeline, infinite variations**

### Subheadline

Build once, deploy everywhere—create social media variants without rebuilding your entire workflow.

### Code Example

```typescript
// Define base product demo
const productDemo = compose(
  generateVideo({
    model: replicate("bytedance/seedance-1-pro"),
    prompt: "Hero shot of smartphone, cinematic lighting",
    duration: 3,
  }),
  generateVideo({
    model: replicate("bytedance/seedance-1-pro"),
    prompt: "Close-up of app interface",
    duration: 4,
  }),
  merge(),
);

// Create variants for different platforms
const instagramReel = compose(
  productDemo,
  lipSync({ audioUrl: "voiceover.mp3" }),
  addSubtitles(),
  reframe({ aspectRatio: "9:16" }),
);

const linkedInPost = compose(
  productDemo,
  lipSync({ audioUrl: "voiceover.mp3" }),
  addSubtitles(),
  reframe({ aspectRatio: "1:1" }),
);

// Execute in parallel
const [instagram, linkedin] = await Promise.all([
  instagramReel.execute(),
  linkedInPost.execute(),
]);
```

## Tone & Voice Guidelines for Copy

- **Developer-first:** Speak to engineers who understand the pain
- **Confident, not hyped:** This is the obvious solution, not a miracle
- **Technical but accessible:** Show code, but explain why it matters
- **Problem-aware:** Lead with pain points developers actually feel
- **No fluff:** Every sentence should inform or persuade

---

## Image/Illustration Descriptions

### Hero Illustration

Clean, technical diagram showing multiple provider logos (Replicate, Fal, ElevenLabs, Hume) with their distinctive branding connecting through organized lines/nodes to a central "Synthome SDK" interface element, which then connects to a polished output (video player or media file). Use a dark/neutral background with accent colors from each provider's branding. Vercel/Stripe aesthetic—minimal, precise, professional.

---

### Pain Point Illustration (Before/After Split)

**Left Side (Before):** Chaotic spaghetti diagram showing different provider API boxes (each with unique shapes/colors) with tangled, crossed lines connecting to a codebase icon. Include warning triangles, broken link symbols, and error indicators. Visual clutter representing complexity.

**Right Side (After):** Clean linear flow: multiple provider icons → single Synthome interface box → organized pipeline steps → completed video output. Straight lines, organized layout, no errors. Same providers, zero chaos.

---

### executeJSON Section Illustration

Three-stage flow:

1. **Stage 1:** Code editor window or AI agent icon generating JSON (show snippet of the JSON with syntax highlighting)
2. **Stage 2:** Arrow pointing to Synthome logo/processor icon with gear elements
3. **Stage 3:** Completed video player or media thumbnail with "ready" indicator

Use a horizontal flow layout with a subtle tech gradient background. Should feel like a "build pipeline" visualization.

---

### Code Block Styling

- Dark theme (match developer preference)
- Syntax highlighting for TypeScript
- Line numbers optional
- Copy button in top-right corner
- Subtle shadow/border to lift off page
- Use monospace font (Fira Code, JetBrains Mono, or similar)

---
