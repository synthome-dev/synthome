# AI Content Generation Guide: Creating High-Quality SEO Content

## The Problem with AI-Generated Content

Most AI-generated content fails because it's:

- Generic (same as everyone else using AI)
- No original insights or data
- Missing real examples
- Lacks depth and expertise
- Obvious "AI voice" (sounds robotic)

**Google's stance:** They don't penalize AI content. They penalize **unhelpful** content, regardless of how it's made.

**Your goal:** Make AI content that's BETTER than human-written competitor content.

---

## The Secret: AI + Unique Inputs = Quality Content

```
Generic Prompt + AI = Generic Content (BAD)
Unique Data + AI = Unique Content (GOOD)
```

**The formula:**

1. **Unique inputs** (your data, examples, expertise)
2. **Strategic prompts** (specific, detailed instructions)
3. **Human refinement** (editing, adding insights)
4. **Real examples** (from Synthome, customers, use cases)

---

## What Makes Content "High Quality" for Google

### E-E-A-T Signals (What Google Looks For)

| Signal         | What It Means                    | How to Add It                         |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Experience** | First-hand experience with topic | Add real examples from using Synthome |
| **Expertise**  | Deep knowledge of subject        | Include technical details, edge cases |
| **Authority**  | Recognized as a leader           | Reference your product, link to docs  |
| **Trust**      | Accurate, honest information     | Cite sources, show real results       |

### Content Quality Factors

1. **Original information** - Data, research, examples nobody else has
2. **Comprehensive coverage** - Answers all user questions
3. **Practical value** - Actionable, not just informational
4. **Clear structure** - Easy to scan and read
5. **Accurate details** - Technically correct

## Content Enrichment: What to Add After AI Draft

### 1. Add Real Examples

**Before (AI-generated):**

```
AI video generation can save time for marketing teams.
```

**After (enriched):**

```
AI video generation can cut production time by 90%.
For example, [Company X] used Synthome to generate 50 product
videos in 2 hours—work that previously took their team 2 weeks.
```

### 2. Add Specific Numbers

**Before (AI-generated):**

```
AI image generation is cost-effective compared to traditional methods.
```

**After (enriched):**

```
AI image generation costs $0.02-0.10 per image, compared to:
- Stock photos: $5-50 per image
- Custom photography: $200-500 per image
- Freelance design: $50-150 per image

At 1,000 images/month, that's $20-100 vs $5,000-50,000.
```

### 3. Add Code That Works

**Before (AI-generated):**

```
You can use the Synthome SDK to generate images.
```

**After (enriched):**

```typescript
import { Synthome } from "@synthome/sdk";

const client = new Synthome({
  apiKey: process.env.SYNTHOME_API_KEY,
});

// Generate a product image
const image = await client.image.generate({
  model: "stable-diffusion-xl",
  prompt:
    "Professional product photo of a white sneaker, studio lighting, white background",
  width: 1024,
  height: 1024,
});

console.log(image.url); // https://...
```

### 4. Add Comparison Tables

**Before (AI-generated):**

```
There are several AI video models available, each with different strengths.
```

**After (enriched):**

| Model        | Speed | Quality    | Cost     | Best For               |
| ------------ | ----- | ---------- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| Runway Gen-3 | 30s   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | $0.50/5s | High-quality marketing |
| Pika         | 15s   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐   | $0.20/5s | Quick social content   |
| Stable Video | 45s   | ⭐⭐⭐     | $0.10/5s | Budget projects        |
| Kling        | 60s   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐   | $0.15/5s | Longer clips           |

### 5. Add Pro Tips

**Before (AI-generated):**

```
Make sure to write good prompts for better results.
```

**After (enriched):**

```
> 💡 **Pro Tip:** Start your prompt with the output format, then add details.
>
> ❌ Bad: "A cat sitting on a couch in a living room with nice lighting"
> ✅ Good: "Professional photograph, 4K, studio lighting: orange tabby cat
>    sitting on mid-century modern sofa, soft natural light from window"
>
> This simple reorder improves output quality by ~40% in our testing.
```
