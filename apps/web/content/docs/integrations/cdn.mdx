## Setup

Connect your storage through the [Synthome Dashboard](https://synthome.dev):

1. Go to **Dashboard > Integrations**
2. Click **Add Storage**
3. Enter your S3-compatible credentials:
   - Access Key ID
   - Secret Access Key
   - Endpoint URL (for non-AWS services)
   - Bucket name
   - Region (optional)
4. Click **Save**

Once connected, all generated media will be automatically uploaded to your storage.

## Bucket Configuration

### Public Access

For generated media to be accessible via URL, configure your bucket for public read access.

**Amazon S3 Bucket Policy:**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Cloudflare R2:**

Enable public access through R2's public bucket feature or connect a custom domain in the Cloudflare Dashboard.

### CORS Configuration

If accessing media from a web application, configure CORS on your bucket:

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET"],
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3600
  }
]
```
