# Core Concepts

Synthome SDK is built around three core concepts: **Pipelines**, **Models**, and **Providers**. Understanding these concepts will help you build powerful media generation workflows.

## Architecture Overview

```typescript
compose(                            // Pipeline
  merge([                           // Operation
    generateVideo({                 // Generation
      model: videoModel(            // Model
        "bytedance/seedance-1-pro",
        "replicate"                 // Provider
      ),
      prompt: "Scene 1"
    }),
    generateVideo({ ... }),
  ]),
).execute()
```

## The Three Pillars

### 1. Pipelines

Pipelines define **what** operations to perform and in **what order**. Use `compose()` to chain operations together:

```typescript
const pipeline = compose(
  merge([
    generateVideo({ ... }),
    generateVideo({ ... }),
  ]),
);
```

Pipelines are lazy - they don't execute until you call `.execute()`. This lets you build complex workflows and run them when ready.

### 2. Models

Models define **which AI model** to use for generation. Synthome uses a unified model naming system that works across providers:

```typescript
// Unified model name + provider
const model = videoModel("bytedance/seedance-1-pro", "replicate");
```

The same model name works regardless of which provider hosts it. Switch providers by changing one argument.

### 3. Providers

Providers are the **infrastructure** that runs the AI models. Synthome supports multiple providers:

- **Replicate** - Video and image generation
- **Fal** - Fast image generation and lip-sync
- **ElevenLabs** - Text-to-speech
- **Hume** - Expressive TTS

You bring your own API keys, and Synthome orchestrates the calls.

## How It All Fits Together

When you execute a pipeline:

1. **Pipeline** is converted to an execution plan (JSON)
2. **Synthome API** receives the plan and schedules jobs
3. **Jobs** run in parallel when possible, waiting for dependencies when needed
4. **Results** are collected and returned (or sent via webhook)

```typescript
// Build the pipeline - mix URLs with generated media
const pipeline = compose(
  merge([
    // Direct URL - no generation needed
    "https://example.com/intro.mp4",
    // Generated videos - run in parallel
    generateVideo({
      model: videoModel("bytedance/seedance-1-pro", "replicate"),
      prompt: "A rocket launching",
    }),
    generateVideo({
      model: videoModel("bytedance/seedance-1-pro", "replicate"),
      prompt: "Earth from orbit",
    }),
  ]),
);

// Execute and wait for results
const execution = await pipeline.execute();
console.log(execution.result?.url);
```

## Key Benefits

| Concept   | Benefit                                          |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Pipelines | Compose complex workflows from simple operations |
| Models    | Unified naming across providers                  |
| Providers | Use best-in-class models from multiple platforms |
