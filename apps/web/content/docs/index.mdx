# Synthome SDK

Synthome is a TypeScript SDK for building composable AI media pipelines. Generate videos, images, and audio, then combine them with powerful operations like merging, layering, captioning, and more.

## Why Synthome?

Building AI-powered media applications typically requires:

- Managing multiple AI provider APIs (Replicate, Fal, ElevenLabs, etc.)
- Handling async job polling and status tracking
- Orchestrating complex multi-step pipelines
- Converting between different media formats
- Uploading results to your CDN

Synthome abstracts all of this into a simple, composable API:

```typescript
import {
  compose,
  generateVideo,
  merge,
  captions,
  videoModel,
  audioModel,
} from "@synthome/sdk";

const result = await compose(
  captions({
    video: merge([
      generateVideo({
        model: videoModel("bytedance/seedance-1-pro", "replicate"),
        prompt: "A sunrise over mountains",
      }),
      generateVideo({
        model: videoModel("bytedance/seedance-1-pro", "replicate"),
        prompt: "A peaceful lake at dawn",
      }),
    ]),
    model: audioModel("vaibhavs10/incredibly-fast-whisper", "replicate"),
  }),
).execute();

console.log("Video URL:", result.result?.url);
```

## Key Features

### Multi-Provider Support

Use models from Replicate, Fal, ElevenLabs, Hume, and Google Cloud through a unified API. Switch providers without changing your code.

### Composable Pipelines

Chain operations together with `compose()`. Generate media, transform it, merge multiple sources, add effects - all in a single pipeline.

### Type-Safe

Full TypeScript support with autocomplete for model names, providers, and options.

### Unified Model API

Reference models by canonical names like `"bytedance/seedance-1-pro"` instead of provider-specific IDs.

### Built-in Operations

- `generateVideo()` - Text-to-video, image-to-video
- `generateImage()` - Text-to-image, image-to-image, background removal
- `generateAudio()` - Text-to-speech, transcription
- `merge()` - Combine videos, images, and audio
- `layers()` - Composite media with positioning and effects
- `captions()` - Auto-generate and burn subtitles

### Async-First

Built for production with webhook support, progress tracking, and robust error handling.

### Direct CDN Upload

Results are automatically uploaded to your own S3-compatible storage. Connect Cloudflare R2, Amazon S3, or any S3-compatible CDN and get direct URLs to your media files - no temporary links or manual downloads.
