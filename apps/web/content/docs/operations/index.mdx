# Operations

Operations transform and combine media. Unlike generation functions that create new content, operations work with existing media (URLs or generated content).

| Operation    | Description                                        |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `merge()`    | Combine multiple videos, images, or audio into one |
| `layers()`   | Composite media with positioning and effects       |
| `captions()` | Add captions/subtitles to a video                  |

## Quick Examples

### Merge Videos

```typescript
import { compose, merge } from "@synthome/sdk";

const execution = await compose(
  merge([
    "https://example.com/intro.mp4",
    "https://example.com/main.mp4",
    "https://example.com/outro.mp4",
  ]),
).execute();
```

### Add Captions

```typescript
import { compose, captions, audioModel } from "@synthome/sdk";

const execution = await compose(
  captions({
    video: "https://example.com/video.mp4",
    model: audioModel("vaibhavs10/incredibly-fast-whisper", "replicate"),
    style: { preset: "tiktok" },
  }),
).execute();
```

### Layer Media

```typescript
import { compose, layers } from "@synthome/sdk";

const execution = await compose(
  layers([
    { media: "https://example.com/background.mp4" },
    { media: "https://example.com/overlay.png", placement: "pip" },
  ]),
).execute();
```

## Combining with Generation

Operations work seamlessly with generation functions:

```typescript
const execution = await compose(
  captions({
    video: merge([
      generateVideo({
        model: videoModel("bytedance/seedance-1-pro", "replicate"),
        prompt: "Scene 1",
      }),
      generateVideo({
        model: videoModel("bytedance/seedance-1-pro", "replicate"),
        prompt: "Scene 2",
      }),
    ]),
    model: audioModel("vaibhavs10/incredibly-fast-whisper", "replicate"),
  }),
).execute();
```

This pipeline:

1. Generates two videos in parallel
2. Merges them into one
3. Transcribes and adds captions
